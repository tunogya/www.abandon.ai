Hello everyone,

If you've ever watched a sunset from a Bali beach, you know the feeling. The sky explodes into a gradient of impossible
colors—pinks, oranges, purples—reflecting off the wet sand as the sound of the waves provides the perfect soundtrack.
How do you capture a feeling like that in a video game?

That was the question that guided us when we began developing our visual identity. We knew we didn't want hyper-realism.
Instead, we wanted to capture the memory of Bali—the vibrant, dreamlike, and sometimes chaotic energy of the island.

That's why we chose pixel art.

For us, pixel art isn't just nostalgia; it's a deliberate artistic choice. It allows us to distill the essence of a
scene down to its most important elements. It’s a style that forces creativity, where every single pixel has a purpose.
Our art style, which we affectionately call "Pixels on the Beach," is our love letter to both classic gaming and modern
island life.

Our Philosophy:

Vibrant & Saturated: We amplify Bali's natural color palette. The lush green of the rice paddies is greener, the
turquoise of the ocean is more brilliant, and the daily canang sari offerings are pops of vibrant color against the
stone.

Modern Meets Retro: We combine classic 16-bit aesthetics with modern techniques like dynamic lighting and particle
effects. Imagine the warm, pixelated glow of a lantern at a night market, or the spray of seafoam as it crashes on the
shore.

Authentic Details: From the specific architecture of a pura (temple) to the brand of instant noodles sold at the local
warung, we are obsessed with the small details that make our virtual world feel lived-in and real.

We believe this style creates a unique aesthetic that feels both familiar and entirely new. It’s a world we can't wait
for you to get lost in. In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more GIFs and screenshots, but for now, we hope this gives
you a taste of the visual soul of our game.
