Hello everyone,

Welcome to our very first dev blog. Today, we want to share the beginning of it all—that slightly crazy dream about
Bali.

The story began a few years ago with a simple trip. At the time, one of our founders was at a crossroads in his life. He
quit his job, packed a single bag, and bought a one-way ticket to Denpasar. He thought it would be a short escape, but
he never expected that the island's magic would change him completely.

He was captivated by the "everyday" life there: at 5 AM, fishermen were already at sea while surfers danced on the waves
at Kuta. In the afternoon, sunlight filtered through the gaps in the rice paddies, illuminating quiet cafes. At night,
the air was filled with the scent of frangipani and the distant sound of Gamelan music.

But what fascinated him most were the "encounters." In a hostel, he met a girl from Germany who was traveling the world,
an Australian guy who was teaching local kids how to code, and a New Yorker who had left a Wall Street job to study
yoga. Everyone had a story. They met for a brief moment, shared a piece of their lives, and then set off on their next
journey.

After that trip, a thought lingered in his mind: **Why isn't there a game that captures this feeling?**

Not a grand narrative about saving the world or fighting monsters, but a more personal, more authentic experience—about
exploration, about aimless wandering, and about the people you meet by chance who leave a lasting impression.

That thought was the seed of this project.

We want to create a world where you can feel the Bali sun and sea breeze anytime, anywhere. We want to use warm,
comforting pixel art to recreate the freedom of riding a scooter down a country road, to depict the serenity of watching
a sunset by the sea.

More importantly, we want to perfect the core experience of "meeting people." This is why we launched the crazy *
*gocamp.id** initiative. We don't want the NPCs in our game to be just cold, programmed characters. We want them to be
backed by real, living souls. We want every person a player meets in the game to potentially correspond to a real friend
who once laughed with us in the real world.

This project is expected to take four years. It's a long journey, but we are full of passion. Because we know that what
we are creating is not just a game, but a living world that carries countless real stories.

Thank you for reading this far. This is just the beginning of our dream, and we sincerely invite you to witness its
creation with us.

Stay tuned. The adventure is about to begin.
