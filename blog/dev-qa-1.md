Hello and welcome to our very first Dev Q&A! We've been blown away by the excitement and the fantastic questions you've
been sending us on Discord and Twitter. We picked three of the most-asked topics for this round. Let's get into it!

1. "The scooters look so fun! How realistic will they be? Can we customize them?" - @DigitalNomad92

Great question! The scooter is more than just a vehicle in Bali; it's a symbol of freedom. We knew we had to get it
right.

We're not aiming for a hardcore driving simulator, but we're focusing on the feel. The satisfying lean as you take a
corner, the gentle bounce as you go over a bumpy path, and the sheer joy of cruising through a tunnel of green rice
paddies. And yes, customization is a huge part of it! You'll be able to change the color, add stickers, and upgrade your
bike to make it uniquely yours. We're even toying with the idea of modeling the infamous "Canggu Shortcut" for our more
adventurous players!

2. "How will social features work in the game? Can I just hang out with my friends?" - @BeachLifeBella

Absolutely. While there is a story to follow, we want the game to be a social destination—a place to simply exist and
hang out. You'll be able to link up with friends and explore the island together.

We're building dedicated social hubs and activities. Imagine starting your session by meeting a friend for a virtual
kopi at a café, then heading to the beach to try and catch the best waves in a co-op surfing mini-game, and ending the
day at a sunset bonfire with other players. The goal is low-pressure, high-vibe socializing.

3. "You've teased romance in the game. How deep will the relationship system be?" - @GamerHeart

We're so excited to talk about this! Romance in our game is about connection, not just checklists. You'll build
relationships with a core cast of interesting, complex characters through shared experiences and meaningful dialogue.

Instead of just giving gifts, you'll get to know them by helping them with their personal projects, exploring the island
together, and choosing dialogue options that reflect the kind of relationship you want to build. Each character has
their own rich backstory and personal growth arc that you'll discover over time. It's a slow-burn summer romance, island
style.
