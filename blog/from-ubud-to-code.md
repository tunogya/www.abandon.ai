Our office is here in Bali, which means our daily "commute" is often our primary source of inspiration. A quick scooter
ride through the rice fields or a weekend trip to a new beach isn't just a breakâ€”it's research. Our mission is to ensure
that when you play our game, you feel the soul of the island.

Today, we want to give you a peek behind the curtain. How do we transform a real-world location, like Ubud, into a
pixelated paradise?

Step 1: Total Immersion (The Fun Part!)
It starts with a field trip. We don't just look at Google Maps. We go there. For Ubud, this meant walking the Campuhan
Ridge Walk at sunrise, getting hopelessly lost in the art market, and dodging the macaques in the Monkey Forest. We take
hundreds of photos, record ambient sounds (the gamelan music, the distant chatter, the ever-present roosters), and
just... absorb the vibe.

Step 2: Artistic Distillation
We can't replicate a location brick-for-brick; that's not the goal. We want to capture its feeling. Our artists take the
reference materials and ask: "What are the most iconic elements?" For Ubud, that's the lush greenery overwhelming
ancient stone carvings, the intricate temple doorways, and the vibrant displays of art. They translate this into our
pixel art style, exaggerating colors and focusing on key architectural details to make it instantly recognizable.

Fun Fact: One of our biggest challenges with Ubud was capturing the feeling of its steep ravines and layered landscape
in our 2.5D perspective. We ended up developing a new layering technique just to make the rice terraces feel as deep and
impressive as they do in real life.

Step 3: Weaving in the Gameplay
A location isn't just a backdrop; it's a playground. We design quests and activities that feel native to the area. In
our virtual Ubud, you won't be fighting dragons. You'll be taking a silver-making class, participating in a yoga
workshop, or helping a local artist find inspiration. The gameplay is born from the location itself.

From Ubud to Uluwatu, every location in our game is a place we've personally explored and fallen in love with. We hope
that love shines through in every pixel.
