# About Us: Abandon Inc.

We are **Abandon Inc.**, a small team of developers, artists, storytellers, and travel enthusiasts.

### Our Mission

To us, the word "Abandon" doesn't mean "to give up." It means "to give oneself over to." We are dedicated to creating virtual worlds you can completely give yourself over toâ€”a place where you can temporarily abandon the worries of reality and indulge your imagination and curiosity.

We believe that games are the "spiritual campgrounds" of the modern age, a powerful medium that can connect people from different cultures and provide profound emotional experiences.

### The Team

Our team members are scattered across the globe, brought together by a common dream. We have veteran programmers from big game studios, indie illustrators with a passion for pixel art, and writers who have turned their travel stories into books.

We don't have a big corporate office. We champion remote collaboration and a flexible work style, just like the "digital nomad" lifestyle we advocate in our game. This structure allows us to focus more on the creation itself, rather than corporate processes.

### Our Philosophy

* **Community-Driven:** We believe our players are part of the game world. During our four-year development cycle, we will stay closely connected with our community through our blog, social media, and the gocamp.id project. Your feedback is vital fuel for the game's growth.
* **Craftsmanship:** We are not rushing to release. We are pursuing quality. Every detail of the pixel art, every line of code, and every piece of dialogue will be polished with care to ensure the final product is a world full of soul.
* **Bridging the Real and Virtual:** gocamp.id is the boldest practice of our philosophy. We believe the most moving stories come from real life. By integrating the stories of real players into our game, we hope to break the boundaries between the virtual and the real, creating an unprecedented level of immersion.

Thank you for your interest in our project. We look forward to you joining us to witness the birth of this world.
