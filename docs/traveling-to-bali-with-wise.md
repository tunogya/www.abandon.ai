# Traveling to Bali? Wise is Your Best Friend!

For all the adventurers, dreamers, and future digital nomads planning a trip to the beautiful island of Bali, we want to
share a travel tip that will save you time, money, and a lot of hassle: **use Wise (formerly TransferWise)!**

## Why Wise is a Game-Changer for Travelers in Bali

When you're traveling internationally, dealing with currency exchange rates, high bank fees, and slow transfers can be a
real pain. Wise solves all of these problems, making it the perfect financial companion for your Bali adventure.

With Wise, you can:

* **Hold and exchange over 50 currencies** at the real mid-market exchange rate.
* **Get a debit card** that you can use to spend in the local currency (Indonesian Rupiah) without any hidden fees.
* **Send and receive money internationally** with incredibly low and transparent fees.

It's the easiest and cheapest way to manage your money while you're exploring everything Bali has to offer.

## We Accept Wise Payments!

We believe in making things as easy as possible for our community. That's why both the **Abandon** game project and our
**[gocamp.id](https://gocamp.id)** Bali experience camps accept payments from Wise users all over the world.

Whether you're sponsoring the development of Abandon or booking your spot in one of our immersive Bali camps, you can do
it seamlessly with Wise.
