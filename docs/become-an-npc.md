# Become a Permanent NPC in the Game

This is our boldest, craziest, and most exciting plan. We are inviting you to become a part of our game before it even exists—as an NPC who will live forever in our pixelated world of Bali.

### What is gocamp.id?

**gocamp.id** is our real-world experience project. It's not a simple tour group; it's a carefully designed, deep-dive into Bali centered around the themes of "Exploration, Creativity, and Connection." You will spend an unforgettable time in the real Bali with members of our development team and other future "NPCs."

### How Does It Work?

The entire process is a magical adventure:

1.  **Sign Up to Join:** Visit the [gocamp.id](https://gocamp.id) website, choose a camp theme and date that interests you, and complete the registration.
2.  **Experience the Real Bali:** During the camp, you'll participate in activities like surf lessons, scooter explorations, and local cultural workshops. We will encourage you to share your own stories, dreams, and travel insights.
3.  **Story & Character Capture:** Our team members will be there with you as friends and guides. Through casual conversations and observation, we'll get to know your personality, catchphrases, and interesting stories, and take reference photos.
4.  **Pixelated Rebirth:** Back at the studio, our artists and designers will create a unique pixel NPC character inspired by you. Your stories will be adapted into in-game dialogue or small quests, and your personality will give the NPC its unique soul.
5.  **Live Forever in the Game:** When the game is officially released, you'll be able to find "you" somewhere on the island! You can interact with "yourself" and show your friends—"See that cool person playing the guitar on the beach? That's me!"

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is there a fee to participate in gocamp.id?**
A: Yes. gocamp.id is a real-world travel experience. The fee covers your accommodation, activities, some meals, and transportation in Bali. This fee supports the operation of the camp and helps us continue the game's development.

**Q: Do I need to have a special talent or an amazing story? I'm just an ordinary person.**
A: Not at all! We firmly believe that everyone is unique and every story is worth hearing. "Ordinary" is the most authentic and compelling material. We are looking for genuine personalities, not dramatic performances.

**Q: Can I decide what my NPC does in the game?**
A: You won't have complete creative control, as our team needs to ensure the NPC fits cohesively within the game world. However, we promise that the NPC design will be based on respect and goodwill for you as a person. It is meant to be a tribute to your uniqueness, not a caricature.

**Q: When will I see my NPC in the game?**
A: You will see your NPC when the game is officially released in approximately four years. All gocamp.id participants will receive a free copy of the game as our thank you.

**Q: If I can't join gocamp.id, are there other ways to support the project?**
A: Of course! You can follow our dev blog and share our project with your friends. We may also open other forms of crowdfunding or pre-orders in the future, so please stay tuned!
