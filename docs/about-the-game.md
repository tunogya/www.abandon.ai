# About the Game: A Pixelated Bali Dream

What we want to build is more than just a game. We want to create a "place"—a place you can always "return" to when you feel tired and need a break. That place is our pixelated Bali.

### Our Inspiration

Many members of our team have been digital nomads or backpackers, and the freedom, warmth, and tranquility of Bali left an indelible mark on us. The morning waves, the afternoon sun on the rice paddies, the fireflies at night, and the stories shared with travelers we just met... we hope to convey this unique "on the road" feeling through the retro and warm medium of pixel art.

The game is heavily inspired by beloved simulation classics like *Stardew Valley*, *Animal Crossing*, and *Harvest Moon*. We love the sense of community and belonging they create. At the same time, we want to infuse it with the modern travel experience of "exploration" and "fleeting connections."

### Core Mechanics

* **A Stress-Free Pace of Life:** The game has no mandatory main questline. You can live at your own pace—whether that's surfing every day, exploring the inland on your scooter, or just chatting with friends at a beachside cafe for an afternoon.
* **Dynamic Social System:** The NPCs in the game are more than just quest-givers. They have their own stories, personalities, and daily routines. Your interactions with them will be dynamic, and your relationships will change over time and through shared experiences. Some friendships will last a lifetime; others will be like fellow travelers—brief but beautiful.
* **Deep Exploration Experience:** The entire island is an open world, filled with explorable locations, puzzles to solve, and hidden collectibles. We want players to feel the same freshness and excitement as when they first set foot on a new land.
* **Personalization & Creativity:** You can decorate your own hut, learn to cook Balinese cuisine, and even learn to make local handicrafts. The game encourages you to leave your unique mark.

### The Player Experience

We want you to experience:

* **Relaxation & Healing:** Escape the noise of reality and enjoy a moment of peace.
* **Adventure & Curiosity:** Rekindle your curiosity for the unknown.
* **Connection & Empathy:** Find emotional resonance in the people you meet.

This is a game about freedom, discovery, and self-expression. Welcome to the journey.
